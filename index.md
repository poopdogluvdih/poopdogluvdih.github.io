# Hello, I'm `audrNa` !

👋 You can call me **audr**.

🎮 Favorite games: Arknights, osu!, Honkai: Star Rail, Project Sekai, Phigros, Beatblock, Baba Is You, etc...

🛠️ I also code to make stuff but I like making games for fun! (Check out my [projects](/tabs/projects) later!)

🤓 My best skills are general programming, Godot Engine, and Python. I also have some experience with various fields such as C, JavaScript, Jekyll, SQL, Flask, React, etc.

🚩 Currently studying programming and game design (more focus on this now) on my own, but school is slowing me down...
